Goal: Detailed inferred questions for file handling exercises.

p1.py
Detailed inferred question set:
- In file `text.txt`, check whether user-entered word is present.
- Print last 5 lines from `new.txt`.
- Count letters, digits, and spaces in file content.
- Replace the second line of `new.txt` with `line is changed` and write back.

p2.py
Detailed inferred question:
- Read complete content from `new.txt` and append it into another file (e.g., `new1.txt`).
- Then display appended content.

p3.py
Detailed inferred question:
- Build menu-driven file manager using `os` module:
  1) Write file
  2) Read file
  3) Append file
  4) Search word in file
  5) Delete file
  6) Exit
- Include file existence checks before operations.

p4.py
Detailed inferred question:
- Print all numbers from `1` to `100` that are divisible by `3` or `5` but not both.
