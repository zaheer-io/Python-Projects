Goal: Detailed inferred questions with exact sample data.

fileop1.py
Detailed inferred question:
- Build file utility with extension chooser (`.txt` / `.py`) and operations:
  write/create, read, append, search word, delete.
- Ask overwrite confirmation when file already exists.

p.py
Detailed inferred question:
- Read a sentence and create dictionary:
  `{word: {'length': len(word), 'is_palindrome': bool, 'count': frequency}}`.

p1.py
Detailed inferred question:
- Read sentence and build per-word dictionary including:
  `length`, `count`, `is_palindrome`, `number_of_vowels`, `number_of_consonants`.

p2.py
Detailed inferred question:
- Read string, ignore spaces, and create character dictionary:
  `{char: {'count': n, 'is_vowel': bool, 'ascii': ord(char)}}`.

p3.py
Detailed inferred question:
- Input student name and marks as comma-separated text.
- Build nested dictionary:
  `{name: {'marks': score, 'grade': A/B/C/D/F, 'pass': True/False}}`.

p4.py
Detailed inferred question:
- Given list of tuples
  `[("apple",3), ("banana",5), ("apple",2), ("orange",1)]`,
  convert into merged dictionary count format.

p5.py
Detailed inferred question:
- Reverse dictionary problem:
  from `{"a":1, "b":2, "c":1}` create `{1:["a","c"], 2:["b"]}`.
  (File currently incomplete.)

p6.py
Detailed inferred question:
- Parse employee data string
  `"101,John,HR,35000;102,Ana,IT,55000;103,Sam,Sales,45000"`
  into nested dictionary keyed by employee id.

p8.py
Detailed inferred question:
- Read comma-separated numbers and build dictionary:
  `{num: {'square': num**2, 'cube': num**3, 'iseven': bool, 'isodd': bool}}`.

p9.py
Detailed inferred question:
- Given `keys=["a","b","c"]` and `values=[10,20,30]`, create forward mapping dictionary and also reverse mapping.

p10.py
Detailed inferred question:
- Given marks dictionary
  `{'zaheer':50,'anjana':85,'archana':62,'appus':49,'rahim':69}`
  sort by keys and values in ascending and descending order.

p11.py
Detailed inferred question:
- Group anagrams from list
  `["eat","tea","ate","bat","tab","arc","car"]`
  using sorted-letter key.

p12.py
Detailed inferred question:
- Read sentence and create dictionary where key is word length and value is list of words having that length.

p13.py
Detailed inferred question:
- Convert list
  `[{"id":1,"name":"John"},{"id":2,"name":"Ana"}]`
  into `{1:"John", 2:"Ana"}`.

p14.py
Detailed inferred question:
- For numbers `1` to `20`, build dictionary:
  `{n: {'prime': True/False, 'factors': [all factors of n]}}`.

p15.py
Detailed inferred question:
- Merge dictionaries `d1={"a":2,"b":3}` and `d2={"a":5,"c":10}`
  to output `{"a":7,"b":3,"c":10}`.
