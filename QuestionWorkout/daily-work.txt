Folder: Daily Work
Goal: Detailed inferred questions with concrete values from each program.

dailytask5.py
Detailed inferred question:
- Read two strings `s1` and `s2` (example in comments: `zaheer` and `reehaz`) and check whether both strings have the same frequency for each character (anagram-style frequency match). Print `Done` if all character counts match and lengths are equal, else print `Not done`.

Dailytask6.py
Detailed inferred question:
- Print the following 6-row pattern using loop logic where row number multiples of 3 are stars:
  1
  22
  ***
  4444
  55555
  ******

DailyTask7.py
Detailed inferred question:
- Print a 7-row binary triangle pattern where odd rows start with `1` and even rows start with `0`, then alternate within the row.
  Example row style:
  Row1: `1`
  Row2: `0 1`
  Row3: `1 0 1`

DailyTask8.py
Detailed inferred question:
- Read two integers from input and print their sum directly in one expression.

DailyTask9.py
Detailed inferred question:
- Given digit-word list
  `['zero','one','two','three','four','five','six','seven','eight','nine']`,
  read an integer (e.g., `507`) and build a dictionary mapping each digit to its word
  (e.g., `{5:'five', 0:'zero', 7:'seven'}`).
